Implements 802.1x authorization and HTTP authorization

Most of the code is copied from zte-client project in google code, thanks to luzj.

Based on zte-client, i just add some features so that it works perfectly in gdst ( a very small college).

For zte-client-linux, framework is changed into another one called K.I.S.S. and most of the code is copied from zruijie4gzhu project in google code thanks to Pentie.
